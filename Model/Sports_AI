Paper: "Predicting Overall Athlete Wellness and Injury Risk in Collegiate Tennis Players: A Machine Learning Approach", 
which investigates the application of machine learning to enhance athlete performance and injury prevention. The study utilized data from wearable devices, workout logs, sleep patterns, and athlete surveys, developing and validating predictive models for both wellness and injury risk.  Trained and evaluated, with XGBoost demonstrating strong results, achieving an R-squared of 0.8378 for wellness prediction and an AUC-ROC of 0.7947 for injury risk classification. This paper highlights the potential of data-driven methods in optimizing athlete management and injury prevention strategies in collegiate tennis.
